# Experiments In Decentralized Freedom Technologies
It seems valuable to give some Matic to newcomers who found their first FreedomCash Wallet so that they can execute their first transactions on Blockchains easily.  

During early phases of the Freedom Cash Project newcomers might receive such a Matic Donation by simply asking for it via [FriendsOfSatoshi](https://t.me/FriendsOfSatoshi_bot).  
This means every Geo Cacher is invited to claim Matic for each Freedom Cash Wallet he has generated and funded or found.   

Early supporters of the Freedom Cash Project did a great job in supporting Geo Cachers especially those who turned out to be newcomers in decentralized freedom technologies.  
To simplify the lives of such supporters also in the Matic distribution context we have deployed [this smart contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xEf27d7c277DbaB70cf5863787A54a67D10e843Da). We might not provide a dedicated visitor interface for this smart contract because early supporters can utilize a standard smart contract interface like [this one](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xEf27d7c277DbaB70cf5863787A54a67D10e843Da#writeContract). Such approaches already worked out pretty well e.g. for initial distributions of [Freedom Cash](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x1Dc4E031e7737455318C77f7515F8Ea8bE280a93) via the [rewards smart contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xf1497128cdb01fbf249e413bf633125d807cfdb4).  

In combination with [FriendsOfSatoshi](https://t.me/FriendsOfSatoshi_bot) the infrastructure for efficient distributions of Matic and Freedom Cash to Geo Cachers all over the world seems sufficient. In case you have ideas on how to incentivize a broad distribution of Matic and Freedom Cash among Geo Cachers even further, please describe your proposals [here](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/education-incentives-experiments/issues/new).  

We invite people to explore and co-create architectures of freedom.  

## Basic Education Goals
1. Interact with Browserwallets like [Metamask](https://metamask.io)  
2. Interact with DEX based liquidity pools e.g. via [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org)
3. Interact with Smart Contract based liquidity pools like also provided via the [Freedom Cash Smart Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x1Dc4E031e7737455318C77f7515F8Ea8bE280a93)

## Basic Liquidity Goals
1. Ensure there is a reasonable amount of ETH/FREE and Matic/FREE liquidity available  
2. Ensure people can explore several marketplaces  
3. Ensure prices are pretty much the same across different market places e.g. via arbitrage bots   

## Basic Flow Goals
1. Incentivize Freedom Cash is able to flow smoothly to everyone who appreciates and co-creates freedom wisely  
2. Incentivize Freedom Cash is able to flow to the [Freedom Cash Smart Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x1Dc4E031e7737455318C77f7515F8Ea8bE280a93)  
3. Incentivize Freedom Cash is able to flow to DEX based liquidity pools
