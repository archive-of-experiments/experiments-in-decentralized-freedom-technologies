# Education Incentives Experiments
It seems valuable to support newcomers who found their first FreedomCash Wallet with some Matic so that they can execute their first transactions on Blockchains easily.  

During early phases of the Freedom Cash Project newcomers might receive such a Matic Donation by simply asking for it via [FriendsOfSatoshi](https://t.me/FriendsOfSatoshi_bot).  
This means every Geo Cacher is invited to claim Matic for each Freedom Cash Wallet he has generated and funded or found. 

We invite people to explore and co-create architectures of freedom.  

## Basic Education Goals
